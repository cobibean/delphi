# Delphi NFT Marketplace - Technical Status Report (March 10 2025 - written by cobi)

## Executive Summary

The Delphi NFT Marketplace is an advanced decentralized application built on the Metis Andromeda blockchain (chain ID 1088). The platform enables users to browse, buy, and sell NFTs using both native METIS and wrapped METIS (WMETIS) tokens. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the current technical implementation, integration status, and a detailed 5-week roadmap for public launch.

## Current Technical Implementation

### Architecture Overview

The application follows a modern React architecture using Next.js 14.1.0 with the following technical stack:

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14.1.0 with React 18.3+
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.0+
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS 3.3.0 with custom "Cosmic Overload" design system
- **Animations**: Framer Motion 12.4.10
- **Web3 Integration**: ThirdWeb SDK V5 (recently migrated from ethers.js)
- **Testing Framework**: Jest with React Testing Library (setup but limited coverage)
- **Smart Contract Interaction**: Direct contract calls via ThirdWeb SDK V5 extensions

### Blockchain Integration

The application interacts with the following smart contracts:

1. **Marketplace Contract**: `0x7e9EE861e3721F9F3664C18A539e63aCb784a208`
   - Functions implemented: `getAllValidListings`, `buyFromListing`, `createListing`
   - Full ABI available in `src/app/constants/MarketplaceABI.ts`

2. **WMETIS Token Contract**: `0x75cb093E4D61d2A2e65D8e0BBb01DE8d89b53481`
   - Functions implemented: `balanceOf`, `approve`, `allowance`, `transfer`
   - Used for token-based purchases
   - Full ABI available in `src/app/constants/WMETISABI.ts`

3. **NFT Contracts**: Various ERC721/ERC1155 contracts
   - Support for both standards with appropriate interfaces
   - Dynamic loading based on asset contract address
   - ABIs available in `src/app/constants/ERC721ABI.ts` and `src/app/constants/ERC1155ABI.ts`

4. **Staking Contracts**: Vesta and Yeti-Apes staking pools
   - Fee distribution mechanism (50/50 split)
   - Integration with external staking dApps

### Data Architecture

The application uses the following core data interfaces:

```typescript
// Direct listing data from marketplace contract
export interface IDirectListing {
  listingId: string;       
  tokenId: string;         
  quantity: string;
  pricePerToken: string;   
  listingCreator: string;  // Seller address
  assetContract: string;
  currency: string;
  tokenType: number; 
  status: number;    
  reserved: boolean;
  // Other fields omitted for brevity
}

// NFT metadata from tokenURI
export interface INFTMetadata {
  image: string;       
  name: string;
  description: string;
  attributes?: INFTAttribute[]; 
}

// Combined listing with NFT metadata
export interface IListingWithNFT extends IDirectListing {
  metadata?: INFTMetadata;
  collectionName?: string;
  sellerAddress?: string; 
}
```

### API Integration

The marketplace service layer (`src/app/services/marketplace-v5.ts`) implements the following core functions:

- `getAllListings()`: Fetches all valid marketplace listings
- `getNFTDetails(assetContract, tokenId)`: Retrieves NFT metadata
- `buyWithMetis(listingId, wallet)`: Purchases NFT with native METIS
- `buyWithWMetis(listingId, wallet)`: Purchases NFT with WMETIS tokens
- `createDirectListing(params, wallet)`: Creates a fixed-price listing
- `getWMetisBalance(address)`: Retrieves a user's WMETIS balance

### Component Structure

The application follows a component-based architecture:

- **NFT Display**: `NFTCard`, `NFTDetailView`, `NFTGrid` components
- **Transaction Management**: `TransactionNotification` component with context provider
