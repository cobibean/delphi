# NFT Minting Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for adding NFT minting functionality to the Delphi platform. The feature will allow users to mint NFTs from newly deployed collections directly through the Delphi user interface, providing a seamless experience for both collection creators and NFT collectors.

## Feature Requirements

1. Display recently deployed NFT collections
2. Show collection metadata (name, description, image)
3. Allow users to mint NFTs from collections with a simple UI
4. Support various minting mechanisms (regular mint, lazy mint, signature-based mint)
5. Show transaction status and confirmation
6. Handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

## Components and Structure

1. **MintCard Component** (`/features/nft/components/MintCard.tsx`)
   - Card-style UI for displaying collection information
   - Mint button with quantity selection
   - Loading states and error handling

2. **useMintNFT Hook** (`/features/nft/hooks/useMintNFT.ts`)
   - Handles contract interaction for minting
   - Manages transaction state
   - Error handling and feedback

3. **Mint Page** (`/features/nft/mint/page.tsx`)
   - Container page for displaying mint-eligible collections
   - Filtering and sorting options
   - Recently deployed collections section

## Technical Implementation Details

### Contract Interaction

We'll use Thirdweb's SDK to interact with NFT contracts, supporting different contract types:

1. **ERC721/ERC1155 Standard Minting**
   - Using `mintTo` function for basic minting
   - Supporting quantity selection for ERC1155

2. **Signature-Based Minting**
   - Using `mintWithSignature` for authorized minting
   - Handling signature verification

3. **Lazy Minting**
   - Using `lazyMint` to defer gas costs
   - Claiming already lazy-minted NFTs

### User Experience

1. **Progress Tracking**
   - Show transaction progress using the existing transaction context
   - Display confirmation when mint is successful

2. **Error Handling**
   - Friendly error messages for common issues
   - Detailed feedback for transaction failures

3. **Wallet Integration**
   - Prompt for wallet connection when needed
   - Handle chain switching if user is on wrong network

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test the `useMintNFT` hook with mock contracts
   - Test the `MintCard` component's UI states

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test mint flow from UI to contract interaction
   - Test error scenarios and recovery

3. **Contract Tests**
   - Test against different NFT contract types
   - Verify correct token minting

4. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Complete flow from collection browsing to successful mint
   - Test on test networks before production

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Structure (Current)
- Create component placeholders
- Set up directory structure
- Create implementation plan

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
- Implement `MintCard` component
- Develop `useMintNFT` hook with basic functionality
- Create mint page with static data

### Phase 3: Contract Integration
- Connect to actual deployed contracts
- Implement contract type detection
- Support different minting methods based on contract type

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Add quantity selection for ERC1155
- Implement signature-based minting
- Add support for lazy minting

### Phase 5: Testing & Refinement
- Comprehensive testing
- UX improvements based on feedback
- Performance optimization

## Dependencies

- Thirdweb SDK for contract interaction
- Transaction context for status tracking
- Toast notifications for user feedback

## Conclusion

This NFT minting feature will enhance the Delphi platform by providing users with a straightforward way to mint NFTs from newly deployed collections. By supporting various minting methods and providing a clean UI, we aim to create a seamless experience for both creators and collectors.
