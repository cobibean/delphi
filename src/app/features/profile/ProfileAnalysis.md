## Current Implementation

### Main Profile Pages
1. **Root Profile Page**: `src/app/features/profile/page.tsx`
   - Client component that imports and re-exports the profile page from 'pages/page.tsx'
   - Acts as a router/entry point to the main profile page

2. **Main Profile Page**: `src/app/features/profile/pages/page.tsx`
   - Fully implemented "Coming Soon" page with:
     - Profile preview section
     - Stats dashboard placeholders
     - "Connect Wallet" functionality
     - Modal for "Coming Soon" notification

3. **My Listings Page**: `src/app/features/profile/pages/my-listings/page.tsx`
   - Shows user's active listings
   - Currently using mock data
   - Implements loading state and empty state

4. **My NFTs Page**: Exists as directory but implementation unclear

### Components
The profile directory has three reusable components:
1. `ProfileHeader.tsx` - Likely for displaying user profile information
2. `ProfileStats.tsx` - For displaying user statistics
3. `ProfileActivity.tsx` - For displaying user activity history

### Documentation Files
Several Markdown files exist that appear to be documentation or implementation notes:
- `README.md`
- `AccountAvatar.md`
- `AccountName.md`
- `getSocialIcon.md`
- `getSocialProfiles.md`

## Current Usage

Based on the analysis:
1. The main entry point for the profile is through `/profile` which routes to the "coming soon" page
2. The `/my-listings` and `/my-nfts` pages appear to be separate routes
3. The Header component currently has separate links to "My NFTs" and "My Listings" which should be combined into a single "Profile" link

## Recommendation
- Combine "My NFTs" and "My Listings" navigation into a single "Profile" link in the header
- Direct this link to `/profile` (which routes to the main profile page)
- The profile page can eventually have tabs or links to specific sections (NFTs, Listings, etc.)
