# Delphi NFT Marketplace – **"Degen Meme Oracle"** Edition

### Because sometimes, you just want your NFT marketplace to look like a 3AM shitpost.

---

## 1. Theme Concept: "Total Tilted Degen"

**Vibe**: Ancient Greek prophecy meets Internet meme chaos. Think: Papyrus scrolls plastered with memes. Constellations replaced by pepes. Greek columns that look slightly melted. Everything is cocked at a 10-degree angle. It’s weird, it’s degenerate, it’s crypto, and it’s 100% intentionally *not* polished.  

---

## 2. Color Palette

The original palette remains, but it’s been amped up with neon blasts and “WTF was that?” combos. Use these ironically or combine them with chaotic layering.

### Primary Colors
1. **"Psycho Orange"** (`#ed8936`): Core accent (we keep this OG color but rename it).
2. **"Turbo Turquoise"** (`#38b2ac`): Secondary accent (likewise).
3. **"12 AM Blackout"** (`#121212`): Ultra-dark background, so the memes pop off the screen.
4. **"Meme Parchment"** (`#f8f5f0`): Off-white for text or comedic bubble speech overlays.
5. **"Degenerate Gold"** (`#D4AF37`): That sweet sweet gold you get after your 10x “ape”.

### Bonus Meme Colors

To truly get silly, add in one or two *clashing* neon touches:
- **"Rekt Pink"**: `#ff0080` – For error states or when you get rugged.
- **"Kek Green"**: `#00ff00` – Because we can’t talk crypto memes without neon green.

### Gradients
- **"Fire in the Discord"**: from Psycho Orange (`#ed8936`) to a more red hue (`#e05252`)  
- **"Mystic Meme Night"**: from 12 AM Blackout (`#121212`) to a deeper gray/blue (`#2d3748`)  
- **"Golden Gains"**: from Psycho Orange to Degenerate Gold  
- **"Ethereal Degens"**: from Turbo Turquoise to that suspicious purple (`#805ad5`)

## 3. Typography

### Font Selections

**We’re ditching classical Cinzel** for something more ironically “off” and borderline comedic. Keep your body text legible, but let headings *scream* in a silly font:

1. **Headings**: `"Comic Neue"` or `"Comic Sans MS"` – because nothing says “we’re serious about our degeneracy” like comedic fonts. If you want the “Greek drama meets meme” vibe, you can also test out `"Bangers"` or `"Impact"` for extra doink.
2. **Body**: Stick to `"Inter"` or `"Poppins"` to keep it readable (some small hint of professionalism).
3. **Accents**: `"Papyrus"` or `"Comic Neue Italic"` – because Papyrus is ironically hated by all designers, and that’s half the fun.

### Text Styles

- **Heading 1**: Big, bold, “Comic Sans,” *tilted 2–5 degrees* with a chunky outline or stroke for that “I drew this in MS Paint” look.
- **Heading 2**: Same comedic style, smaller, with a silly glow effect (like a bootleg neon sign).
- **Heading 3**: Slightly more “normal,” but still in the comedic font.
- **Body**: Clean `"Inter,"` at least for the paragraphs, so that the entire site isn’t a total clown fiesta.
- **Accent Text**: `Papyrus` or italic Comic Neue. Use it ironically on disclaimers or “Not Financial Advice” disclaimers.
- **Button Text**: `Inter` or `Impact`, with an uppercase “APE NOW” vibe.

## 4. Shape Language & Components

We’re doubling down on the tilt:

- **Diagonal, Tilted, and Warped**: Everything from card edges to modals should look like you cut them out with children’s scissors.
- **Comic Speech Bubbles**: For pop-ups or info panels, consider a cartoony bubble that’s angled and definitely not symmetrical.
- **Meme Overlays**: Stamps, stickers, random animated emojis.

### Card System

- **NFT Cards**: Irregular polygons with random diagonal edges and slight 3D tilt. The corners should *not* align. Add silly stroke outlines or “hand-drawn” corners for comedic effect.
- **Content Cards**: Layers that look like “torn memes” or “crumpled scrolls.”
- **Info Panels**: Imagine a Greek column, but it’s wobbling. A comedic filter that makes it look like an inflatable tube man.

### Buttons & Interactive Elements

- **Primary Button**: Big gradient backgrounds, an out-of-control glow, random 2px wiggle or bounce.
- **Secondary Button**: Contrasting comedic border. Maybe repeatedly blinks if you hover.
- **Tertiary Button**: Just text that does a comic “boing” on hover.
- **Toggle/Switch**: A toggle that flips from a “pepe eye” (closed) to a “pepe eye wide open,” or some other internet meme icon that “lights up” when toggled.

### Inputs & Forms

- **Text Input**: Transparent background, but with wiggly neon outlines that shift hue on focus.
- **Dropdown**: Styled like a comedic scroll that unrolls with a cartoon *pop*.
- **Checkbox/Radio**: Meme coin icons (like a little doge face for radio, a frog face for checkbox).
- **Progress Bar**: This can be a Greek key pattern that floods with neon goo as it progresses.

## 5. Decorative Elements

### Patterns & Motifs

1. **Wiggly Greek Key**: A glitchy, bouncy version of the meander pattern.
2. **Pepe Constellations**: Instead of random dots, use little frog faces or doges connected by lines.
3. **Sacred Geometry**: Over the top swirling shapes that occasionally turn into “meme” references (like “HODL” spelled out in geometry).
4. **Oracle Meme Symbols**: A crossover of Greek letters and crypto references (like ξ, ₿, and random rocket emojis).

### Icons & Visual Elements
- **Custom Icon Set**:  
  - Wallet = a pixelated cartoon wallet with “WTF?” on it.  
  - Bell = a rung Greek bell with “gm?” text.  
  - Share icons replaced by rocket ships or bananas.  
- **Dividers**: Meme lines with repeating rocket or frog patterns.
- **Badges**: Instead of laurel wreaths, use laurel wreaths + “XD” emoticons or a “100” emoji floating around.
- **Loaders**: Spinning “prophecy,” but scrawled with “pls wait fren.”

---

## 6. Animation & Interaction

### Micro-interactions

- **Hover Effects**:
  - Cards and images tilt randomly by a few degrees each time you move the mouse.
  - Buttons get a comedic “NYOOM” glow or a wiggle.
- **Click/Tap Feedback**: Over-exaggerated cartoon ripple with “boing” sound effect (if you want to go full silly).
- **State Changes**: Use jarring transitions with comedic easing: `cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55)`, i.e. “elastic” or “bounce.”

### Page Transitions
- **Page Entry**: Elements flying in from random angles or sliding in with comedic spin.
- **Page Exit**: Distort or swirl away in a comedic “warped vanish.”
- **Navigation**: If you want to be *really* silly, each nav click can do a short “pepe fade” or “doge jump.”

### Special Effects
- **Parallax**: Instead of subtle backgrounds, use layered meme references that shift around.
- **Particle Effects**: Confetti made of rocket emojis, or random “LFG” text bits.
- **Text Reveal**: Words “bounce in” letter by letter, like a wacky cartoon.

## 7. Component Design Specs

### Header
- **Big, Tilted Logo**: Possibly a meme-ified Greek column with a silly face.
- **Navigation**: Each link is a big wiggly hover underline with neon blink.  
- **Wallet Button**: A cartoon shield or coin with “Ape In” text.
- **Notification**: A random “ping!” bubble that might show a meme face.

### NFT Cards
- **Crazy Angles**: The entire card is slanted 5–10 degrees, with corners that look a bit messed up.  
- **Over-the-Top Shadows**: With comedic neon edges.
- **Price Tag**: A cartoonish “oracle scroll” pinned to the top corner or stuck on with an obvious cartoon “tape” overlay.  
- **Creator Badge**: Meme-inspired cameo bubble.  
- **Hover**: The card might do a *slight rotation + scale*, with “wiggly lines” around it.

### NFT Detail View
- **Hero Image**: Maybe a zoomed in parallax tilt that moves with mouse. Add random glitch lines.  
- **Stats**: Circular or star-shaped cartoon meters with comedic icons.  
- **Buy Button**: Big “APE NOW” stamp with swirl and glow.  
- **History**: A comedic timeline with ridiculous labels: “Bought by degen420,” “Paper Hand sold,” “HODLer minted.”  
- **Related NFTs**: Laid out in a chaotic “constellation” with random angles.

### Wallet Connection
- **Oracle’s Seal**: But, ironically, it’s a gaudy sticker that says “Not Financial Advice.”  
- **Dropdown**: Cartoon scroll unrolling with a *pop.*  
- **Address**: Apes out with random “…” truncation that might flicker.  
- **Balance**: A comedic amphora that “fills up” in neon color.

### Featured Sections
- **Hero**: Possibly an acid-trip geometric swirl with random meme icons.  
- **Featured NFTs**: “Spotlight” on pedestals that tilt or bounce.  
- **Collections**: Might have comedic collection logos that do a slight dance.  
- **Trending**: Show a star chart replaced by rocket doodles or frog icons.

### Modals & Notifications
- **Modals**: Big comedic pop-ups that “bounce in.”  
- **Success**: Confetti explosion with “Wen Lambo” text floating.  
- **Error**: Something jarring, red neon flicker with “Rekt” scribbled.  
- **Loading**: Gifs of spinning memecoins or dancing frogs.

---

## 8. Responsive Design

- **Mobile**: Keep the comedic tilt, but scale down. Switch from big bouncy text to smaller “still comedic” text. Ensure the chaos doesn’t break the layout.  
- **Tablet**: Slightly more breathing room for the chaotic elements.  
- **Desktop**: Full degeneracy. 3D angles, over-the-top neon, animations galore.

---

## 9. Accessibility Considerations

- Even though it’s chaotic, ensure text color contrast meets minimums. Consider toggles to reduce motion for users who get dizzy from all the bouncing and tilting.
- Use alt text that references the comedic or meme aspect.
- Provide a “Serious Mode” or “SFW Mode” toggle for those at work or with sensitivity to intense visuals.
