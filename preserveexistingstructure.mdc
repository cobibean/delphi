# Preserve Existing Structure While Integrating Thirdweb V5

## Core Guidelines

1. **Maintain existing file paths**: Don't create new folder structures. Instead, update existing files in-place with Thirdweb V5 integration.

2. **Keep all components**: Don't replace existing components with new ones. Update the Thirdweb-related code within them.

3. **Preserve styling and design**: Keep all CSS classes, styling, and design elements exactly as they are.

4. **Keep page structure**: Maintain the current page hierarchy and routing.

5. **Focus on Thirdweb V5 integration**: Only change the blockchain interaction code to use Thirdweb V5 SDK instead of previous methods.

## Implementation Approach

1. Update `layout.tsx` to use the latest Thirdweb V5 Provider syntax.

2. Update the client.ts file to use Thirdweb V5 methods instead of ethers.js directly.

3. Create or update hooks in the existing hooks directory to use Thirdweb V5 React hooks.

4. Update wallet connection components to use Thirdweb V5 wallet connection functionality.

5. Update contract interaction code to use Thirdweb V5's contract interaction methods.

6. Keep all UI components, navigation, pages, and routing exactly as they are.

7. Ensure all Thirdweb V5 implementations follow the documentation in the `thirdweb_typescript_docs` directory.

## Priority Areas for Thirdweb V5 Integration

1. Wallet connection and authentication
2. Contract reads (useReadContract)
3. Contract writes (useSendTransaction, etc.)
4. Chain and network management
5. Transaction handling and monitoring

## What NOT to Change

1. Do not create new files if equivalent files already exist
2. Do not change the component hierarchy
3. Do not alter the visual design or CSS classes
4. Do not modify functionality that is not blockchain-related
5. Do not change the page structure or routing
