# ThirdWeb Template Migration Context

## Current Status: Completed (Full Migration Finished)

We have successfully completed the ThirdWeb template migration. Below is the current status and what has been accomplished.

### Completed Steps

1. ✅ **Migration Phase 1**: Identified the issue with ABI decoding errors during direct listings creation.

2. ✅ **Migration Phase 2**: Implemented the simplified ThirdWeb template approach:
   - Created a transaction adapter function `executeThirdwebTransaction` in `utils.ts` using `sendAndConfirmTransaction`
   - Implemented simplified marketplace functions in `listings/simplified.ts`:
     - `createDirectListingSimplified`
     - `buyFromDirectListingSimplified`
     - `cancelListingSimplified`
   - Updated `prepareTransactions.ts` to use the new simplified implementations
   - Modified `direct-listing/page.tsx` to directly use ThirdWeb's `sendAndConfirmTransaction`
   - Deleted legacy transaction files:
     - `transactions.ts`
     - `walletTransactions.ts`
     - `TransactionContext.tsx` 
     - `TransactionNotification.tsx`

3. ✅ **Migration Phase 3**: Extended to Auction Functions:
   - Implemented simplified auction functions in `auctions/simplified.ts`:
     - `createAuctionSimplified`
     - `placeBidSimplified`
     - `buyoutAuctionSimplified`
     - `collectAuctionNFTSimplified`
     - `collectAuctionPayoutForSellerSimplified`
   - Updated auction index exports to use the simplified functions
   - Modified `auction/page.tsx` to use ThirdWeb's hooks directly

4. ✅ **TypeScript Resolution**: Fixed type ambiguities:
   - Updated `wallet/index.ts` to explicitly re-export types and avoid TransactionState conflicts
   - Created `exports.ts` as an alternative to directly importing from `index.ts` to avoid Chain type conflicts
   - Updated the main `features/index.ts` to use more specific imports

5. ✅ **Final Cleanup**:
   - Updated `useMarketplaceWallet.ts` to remove references to the deleted `useWalletTransaction` module
   - Added a new `executeDirectTransaction` method that directly uses ThirdWeb's `sendAndConfirmTransaction` 
   - Implemented local state management for transaction status tracking

### Current Approach

We've fully adopted the ThirdWeb template pattern which:
1. Uses the `sendAndConfirmTransaction` helper directly instead of separate send and wait calls
2. Handles approvals properly with separate transactions
3. Uses direct imports from ThirdWeb's extensions
4. Creates cleaner, more maintainable code
5. Provides typed and standardized interactions with ThirdWeb contracts

### Migration Result

The migration has successfully:
1. Aligned our code with ThirdWeb's recommended patterns
2. Simplified our transaction flow
3. Reduced code complexity
4. Made the codebase more maintainable
5. Fixed the ABI decoding error with direct listings and auctions
6. Provided both backwards compatibility and forward-looking APIs for smooth transition

All marketplace operation types (direct listings and auctions) now use the same standardized pattern for interacting with blockchain, which improves code consistency and reduces the chance of errors. The updated `useMarketplaceWallet` hook also provides a clean path forward for new code to use the ThirdWeb approach directly.

## Next Steps

Future enhancements could include:
1. Further testing with actual transactions on testnet/mainnet
2. UI improvements for transaction progress indicators
3. Additional error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. Documentation updates for the team on how to use the new approach
5. Gradually transition existing components to use the `executeDirectTransaction` method
