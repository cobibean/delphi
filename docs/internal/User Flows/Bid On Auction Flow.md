The bidding flow starts in the UI and flows through several components to the
  blockchain:

  1. UI Components:
    - The "Place Bid" button is in AuctionActions.tsx (line 364-369)
    - When clicked, it calls handleShowBidForm() which displays a modal with a bid form
    - The bid form submission is handled by handleBidSubmit() (line 158)
  2. Transaction Execution:
    - In AuctionActions.tsx, the bid is executed via
  executeMarketplaceFunction("placeBid", ...) (line 189)
    - This comes from the useMarketplaceWallet hook (imported at line 3)
  3. Wallet Hook:
    - The useMarketplaceWallet hook (in useMarketplaceWallet.ts) provides a standard
  interface for all marketplace operations
    - When executeMarketplaceFunction is called, it ultimately calls
  executeMarketplaceTransaction (line 83)
  4. Transaction Router:
    - In prepareTransactions.ts, the executeMarketplaceTransaction function routes the
  "placeBid" function call (line 107)
    - It calls the placeBid function from the auctions service module
  5. Auction Service Implementation:
    - The actual bid placement is implemented in auctions/bids.ts via the placeBid
  function (line 57)
    - This function validates inputs, handles the blockchain interaction, and returns the
   transaction result

  When a user places a bid, this entire flow is executed, with each layer providing
  specific functionality:
  - UI components handle user interaction
  - Hooks provide connection to wallet and error handling
  - Service functions handle the actual blockchain calls

  The NFTDetailView also has a similar bidding capability but delegates most of the
  auction functionality to the AuctionActions component.
