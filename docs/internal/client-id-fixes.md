# Thirdweb Client ID and WMETIS Standardization Fixes

## Summary of Changes

As part of our standardization efforts to simplify the marketplace buying experience, we made the following updates:

1. **Fixed Thirdweb Client ID References**
   - Updated all files to use `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID` directly instead of importing from constants
   - Files updated:
     - `src/app/features/wallet/hooks/useWallet.ts`
     - `src/app/layout.tsx`
     - `src/app/config/client.ts`

2. **Removed WMETIS References**
   - Removed `WMETIS_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` imports and implementations
   - Standardized on using `NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS` from Thirdweb
   - Files updated:
     - `src/app/config/client.ts` (removed getWMetisContract function)
     - `src/app/create/direct-listing/page.tsx` (now uses NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS)
     - `src/app/create/auction/page.tsx` (now uses NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS)

3. **Benefits of Using Environment Variables Directly**
   - More secure (reduces unnecessary imports)
   - Follows best practices for environment configuration
   - Reduces dependency on constants file for critical values
   - Makes deployment and configuration more straightforward

## Implementation Notes

- The `.env` file should always include `NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID` for the app to function correctly
- All marketplace transactions now use native METIS directly
- This standardization removes the multi-step transaction process (wrap METIS → approve WMETIS → complete purchase)
- Users will now have a more streamlined experience with fewer transaction confirmations required

## Additional Steps

Some documentation files still contain references to WMETIS for historical context. These can be updated if needed but don't affect functionality:
- `docs/TECHSTACK.md`
- `README.md`
- `hooks-inventory.md`
