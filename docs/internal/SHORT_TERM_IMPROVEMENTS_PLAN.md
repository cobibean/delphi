# Short-Term Project Structure Improvements Plan

This document outlines a detailed implementation plan for the short-term improvements identified in the project structure evaluation. The goal is to enhance the codebase organization, improve developer experience, and set a foundation for future scalability.

## 1. Consolidate UI Components

**Objective**: Merge `ui/` and `components/` directories to reduce confusion about where to place components.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Audit Current Components** (Estimated time: 1 day) ✅
   - Create an inventory of all components in both `ui/` and `components/` directories
   - Identify any duplicate functionality or similar components
   - Document component dependencies and usage patterns

2. **Define Component Organization Strategy** (Estimated time: 0.5 day) ✅
   - Decide on a clear categorization system (domain-driven organization)
   - Create a component naming convention document
   - Define rules for when to create new components vs. extending existing ones

3. **Create New Directory Structure** (Estimated time: 0.5 day) ✅
   - Create a new component directory structure following domain-driven design:
     ```
     /src/app/
     ├── components/              # Shared components used across multiple domains
     │   ├── ui/                  # Generic UI primitives (Button, Input, etc.)
     │   ├── layout/              # Layout components (Container, Grid, etc.)
     │   ├── feedback/            # Feedback components (Toast, Alert, etc.)
     │   └── modals/              # Generic modal components
     ├── features/                # Domain-specific features
     │   ├── marketplace/         # Marketplace feature
     │   │   ├── components/      # Marketplace-specific components
     │   │   ├── hooks/           # Marketplace-specific hooks
     │   │   └── services/        # Marketplace-specific services
     │   ├── nft/                 # NFT feature
     │   │   ├── components/      # NFT-specific components
     │   │   └── hooks/           # NFT-specific hooks
     │   ├── wallet/              # Wallet feature
     │   │   └── components/      # Wallet-specific components
     │   └── profile/             # Profile feature
     │       └── components/      # Profile-specific components
     ```

### Implementation Steps

1. **Define Naming Standards** (Estimated time: 0.5 day) ✅
   - Directory names: kebab-case (e.g., `my-listings/`)
   - Component files: PascalCase (e.g., `NFTCard.tsx`)
   - Utility/hook files: camelCase (e.g., `useWallet.ts`)
   - Interface/type files: PascalCase with appropriate prefixes (e.g., `INFTMetadata.ts` or `NFTMetadata.types.ts`)

## Success Metrics

The following metrics will help evaluate the success of these improvements:

1. **Developer Productivity**
   - Time spent searching for files
   - Time to onboard new developers
   - Number of import-related errors

2. **Code Quality**
   - Consistency of naming and organization
   - Reduction in duplicate components
   - Improved code discoverability

3. **Project Maintainability**
   - Ease of adding new features
   - Clarity of codebase organization
   - Reduction in technical debt

## Conclusion

Implementing these short-term improvements will establish a solid foundation for the Delphi project's codebase. By consolidating components, standardizing naming conventions, documenting directory purposes, and reducing nesting depth, we'll create a more maintainable and developer-friendly codebase that can scale with the project's growth.

The estimated total time for implementing all improvements is approximately 23 days, but this can be adjusted based on team size and priorities. The benefits of these improvements will be realized immediately in terms of developer productivity and will continue to pay dividends as the project grows.
