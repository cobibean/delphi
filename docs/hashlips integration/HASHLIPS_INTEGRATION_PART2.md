# HashLips Integration Guide - Part 2 (Continued)

## Frontend Integration (Continued)

### 1. Create NFT Generator Page

The NFT Generator page (`src/app/create/nft-generator/page.tsx`) is a React component that provides the user interface for:
- Managing trait layers
- Uploading trait images
- Configuring generation settings
- Previewing generated NFTs
- Uploading to IPFS
- Deploying smart contracts

[The full code for this component was provided in the previous file]

### 2. Create Contract Deployment Page

The Contract Deployment page (`src/app/create/deploy-contract/page.tsx`) handles:
- Collection metadata configuration
- Royalty settings
- Smart contract deployment options
- Contract deployment through Thirdweb SDK

[The full code for this component was provided in the previous file]

## Thirdweb NFT Contract Integration

### 1. Contract Types

The integration supports multiple Thirdweb contract types:

1. **NFT Collection (ERC721)**
   - Best for unique 1/1 NFTs
   - Each token is unique
   - Standard minting functionality

2. **Edition (ERC1155)**
   - Supports multiple copies of each NFT
   - More gas-efficient for multiple copies
   - Good for larger collections

3. **Signature Drop (ERC721)**
   - Supports signature-based minting
   - Great for allowlists and presales
   - Delayed reveal capability

4. **NFT Drop (ERC721)**
   - Claim-based minting mechanics
   - Supports phases (public, presale)
   - Good for scheduled releases

5. **Edition Drop (ERC1155)**
   - Multiple copies with claim mechanics
   - Phase-based dropping
   - Efficient for large collections

### 2. Contract Deployment

The deployment process involves:

1. **Collection Setup**
   ```typescript
   const deployParams = {
     name: collectionName,
     description: description,
     symbol: symbol,
     primary_sale_recipient: royaltyRecipient,
     fee_recipient: royaltyRecipient,
     seller_fee_basis_points: royaltyPercentage * 100,
   };
   ```

2. **Contract Selection**
   ```typescript
   // ERC721 Contracts
   const contractAddress = await deployERC721Contract({
     client,
     chain: metisChain,
     account,
     type: contractType === "nft-collection" 
       ? "TokenERC721" 
       : contractType === "nft-drop" 
         ? "DropERC721" 
         : "SignatureDrop",
     params: deployParams
   });

   // ERC1155 Contracts
   const contractAddress = await deployERC1155Contract({
     client,
     chain: metisChain,
     account,
     type: contractType === "edition" ? "TokenERC1155" : "DropERC1155",
     params: deployParams
   });
   ```

3. **Metadata Upload**
   ```typescript
   // Upload collection metadata to IPFS
   const uri = await storage.uploadBatch(metadata);
   ```

4. **Lazy Minting** (for Drop contracts)
   ```typescript
   await contract.erc721.drop.lazyMint({
     metadataWithSupply: metadata.map(m => ({
       metadata: m,
       supply: 1
     }))
   });
   ```

## Deployment Considerations

### 1. Environment Setup

Required environment variables:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_METIS_RPC_URL=your_rpc_url
```

### 2. Dependencies

Add these dependencies to your `package.json`:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@thirdweb-dev/react": "^5.0.0",
    "@thirdweb-dev/sdk": "^5.0.0",
    "canvas": "^2.11.0",
    "fs-extra": "^11.1.0",
    "crypto-hash": "^2.0.1"
  }
}
```

### 3. Asset Management

1. **Storage Considerations**
   - Implement cleanup for temporary files
   - Set up proper file permissions
   - Consider using cloud storage for production

2. **IPFS Configuration**
   - Use Thirdweb's IPFS storage
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Consider pinning service for persistence

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement image compression
   - Add caching for generated assets
   - Consider worker threads for generation

### 4. Security Considerations

1. **File Upload Security**
   - Validate file types
   - Implement size limits
   - Sanitize file names
   - Scan for malware

2. **API Security**
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add authentication
   - Validate all inputs
   - Secure file paths

3. **Smart Contract Security**
   - Test all contract interactions
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Add emergency pause functionality

### 5. Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Error Tracking**
   - Implement proper logging
   - Set up error monitoring
   - Track generation statistics

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Monitor API response times
   - Track resource usage
   - Set up alerts for issues

3. **Updates and Maintenance**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Monitor for security patches
   - Implement backup strategies

### 6. Testing

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test generation logic
   - Test API endpoints
   - Test contract interactions

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test full generation flow
   - Test IPFS uploads
   - Test contract deployment

3. **Load Testing**
   - Test concurrent generations
   - Test large file uploads
   - Test contract interactions under load
