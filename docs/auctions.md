# Auction Bidding in Delphi Marketplace

## How to Place a Bid

1. Browse the marketplace and look for NFTs with an "AUCTION" badge
2. Click on an auction to view detailed information
3. Enter your bid amount (must be at least the minimum bid)
4. Click "Place Bid" and confirm the transaction in your wallet
5. Monitor your active bids in your profile

## Important Notes

- You must have enough METIS in your wallet to cover your bid
- If you're outbid, your funds will be returned to your wallet
- The highest bidder when the auction ends wins the NFT
- Some auctions have a "Buy Now" price that lets you instantly purchase the NFT

## Auction Types

### English Auction
The most common type where each bid must be higher than the previous one.

### Reserve Price Auction
Has a minimum price that must be met for the NFT to be sold.

### Timed Auction
Ends at a specific time, regardless of bidding activity.
