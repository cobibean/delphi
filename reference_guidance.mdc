# Reference Repository Usage Guidelines

The Thirdweb Marketplace Template we've cloned for reference should be used as follows:

- Use it for **understanding implementation patterns** of Thirdweb V5 SDK
- **DO NOT** copy the code directly or clone its structure
- **DO NOT** replicate the UI design or component architecture
- Use it only to learn how specific Thirdweb functions are called and integrated

## Our Approach

Instead, our implementation should:

- Follow the DELPHI_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md for all UI and styling decisions
- Create our own component architecture based on our specific needs
- Use Thirdweb V5 SDK in our own way, adapting their patterns to our requirements
- Implement our unique features that are not in the reference template
- Focus on Metis chain first, with multi-chain as a future enhancement

## Specific Usage

When referencing the template:
- Study how Thirdweb hooks are integrated
- Understand authentication flows
- Learn contract interaction patterns
- See how transactions are handled

But always implement these in our own way, with our own structure and styling.
