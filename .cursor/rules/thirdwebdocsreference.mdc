# Thirdweb Documentation Reference Policy

When building with Thirdweb V5, always reference the official documentation located in the `/thirdweb_typescript_docs` directory.

## Core Guidelines

- **ALWAYS** check the relevant documentation before implementing any Thirdweb-related feature
- After 2 unsolved error attempts, MUST reference the specific .MD files in `/thirdweb_typescript_docs`
- Include documentation reference comments in code (e.g., `// See thirdweb_typescript_docs/React Hooks/useReadContract.md`)
- When unsure about API usage, parameter types, or return values, consult the docs first - not external sources
- When debugging Thirdweb-related errors, documentation should be the first reference point

## Documentation Categories to Reference

- **Core Functions** - for utility functions, chains, and basic blockchain operations
- **React Hooks** - for all React component integration
- **UI Components** - for pre-built UI elements
- **Advanced Topics** - for complex operations like contract deployment or permissions

## In Code Comments

Include specific file references in comments when implementing Thirdweb functionality:

```typescript
// Reference: See thirdweb_typescript_docs/React Hooks/useReadContract.md
const { data, isLoading } = useReadContract({...})
```

## Error Resolution Process

1. First attempt to solve using your knowledge
2. Second attempt exploring related areas of the code
3. **After 2 attempts, MUST reference specific documentation files**
4. Document the solution with a reference to the relevant documentation
