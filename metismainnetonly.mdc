# Metis Mainnet Only Policy

For Delphi NFT Marketplace, we will **exclusively** use Metis Mainnet for all blockchain interactions until multi-chain support is explicitly implemented according to the roadmap.

- Do not implement testnet support (no Metis Goerli)
- Do not create network switching functionality
- All contract interactions should target Metis Mainnet (Chain ID: 1088) only
- Develop directly on Metis Mainnet using minimal gas fees for testing
- Do not create conditional logic for different networks
- Use fixed network configuration in the codebase
- Chain ID should always be 1088 (Metis Andromeda)
- RPC URL should target Metis Mainnet
- Chain configuration should be simplified to only include Metis Mainnet
- Remove any multi-chain or testnet-related code

This rule may be revisited after public launch when we reach the "Multi-Chain Support" item in our roadmap.
